Given that the Internet is lossy by design, the packet loss threshold is a user-controlled parameter for each of the plots.</p><p>This project is a part of <a href=https://aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/ >AquaLab @ Northwestern</a>.</p><p><a href=chart.html>See the chart â€º</a></p><section id=about><h2>About</h2><p>The creation of this chart was motivated by the need for a visual representation of ISP availability (as defined in the <a href=https://alwayson.aqualab.cs.northwestern.edu/report/ >reliability report</a>). It considers the packet loss threshold - the maximum tolerable packet loss rate above which the service is considered "unavailable" - as a variable parameter instead of using the fixed values 1%, 5%, and 10%.</p><p>The chart has three plots:</p><ul><li><em>Unvailability vs. loss threshold</em> shows the average (mean) percentage of time each ISP is "unavailable", against the maximum acceptable packet loss rate.</li><li><em>Unvailability over time</em> shows the percentage of time each ISP is "unavailable" each month, where availability is determined against a selectable fixed packet loss rate.</li><li><em>Single ISP over time</em> shows the same plots as <em>Unvailability vs. loss threshold</em>, but includes only one ISP and shows one line per reporting year (not averaged over time).</li></ul><p></p></section><section id=usage><h2>Usage</h2><p>The chart (built using <a href=https://www.chartjs.org/ >Chart.js</a>) is interactive. You can hover over or tap individual points to see tooltips with their values. Indiviudal ISPs can be shown/hidden by clicking/tapping them in the legend, and clicking an ISP while holding Shift will exclusively show that ISP.</p><p>The controls below the chart can be used as follows:</p><p></p><ul><li>Chart view: selects which plot to view.</li><li>Scale: toggles the y-axis scale between linear and logarithmic.</li><li>ISP: picks the ISPs to include (one or multiple).<ul><li>applicable to the <em>Single ISP over time</em> plot.</li></ul></li><li>Service type: when toggled, shows/hides groups of ISPs according to service technology. Individual ISPs can still be toggled on the chart independently of the state of these checkboxes.<ul><li>applicable to the <em>Unvailability vs. loss threshold</em> and <em>Unavailability over time</em> plots.</li></ul></li><li>Included regions: toggles which regions of the United States are included in the calculated data.</li><li>Packet loss range: configures the range of the x-axis to view. Data not between the bounds won't be shown.<ul><li>applicable to the <em>Unvailability vs. loss threshold</em> and <em>Single ISP over time</em> plots.</li></ul></li><li>Packet loss: configures the packet loss threshold at which availability is calculated.<ul><li>applicable to the <em>Unvailability over time</em> plot.</li></ul></li></ul><p></p></section></main></body></html>
